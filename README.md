# Routable
---


### Concept

Ports and delivery centers still struggle to optimize scheduling because of data siloing. Routable is a neutral third party hosted solution which is able to optimize scheduling across multiple centers - without sharing any data with other parties - so that drivers' time can be saved, gas can be saved, and more deliveries can be served at any given delivery center or port.

### Structure

<ul>
<li>*/server*: Server and api for submitting scheduling data.</li>
<li>*/app*: Mobile app designed for providing schedule/routing information specific to each driver.</li>
<li>*/routable*: Client side reactjs website</li>
</ul>
